 * texel (packed four to a VRAM word, tpage depth field 0), this asset is
 * CardArt_IndexedImage's own 8-bit-a-texel output (up to 255 colours plus
 * transparent 0), packed two to a word, tpage depth field 1 (getTPage's own

 * codebase to copy, so that packing and tpage math are derived here from
 * the PS1's own hardware layout, not guessed. */
