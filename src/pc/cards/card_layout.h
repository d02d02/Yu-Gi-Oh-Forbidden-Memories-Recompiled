/* One place that answers "where does this element of the big-card display
 * go, and should it even be drawn", for the three retail call sites that
 * would otherwise each repeat their own lookup and their own magic numbers
 * -- duel_effect_resource_setup.c's frame list-membership, func_800283F4.c's
 * description box, and func_80028B08.c's title/stats/stars/attribute/art/
 * frame. Re-tuning where an element sits, or adding a layout style, touches
 * card_layout.c only; the call sites stay as they are.
 *
 * Unlike an earlier, settings-based version of this feature, nothing here
 * is a built-in toggle: every answer comes from whichever applied mod
 * declares a "card_layout" key in its manifest (notes/modding.md, "Card
 * layout"), the same way a mod's "title"/"menu" key is read
 * (title_config.h). With no such mod applied, every element answers with
 * retail's own position -- byte-identical behaviour, nothing to configure.
 *
 * x/y are an offset in the same coordinate neighbourhood as the retail code
 * they replace (func_80028B08.c's own +0x13, +0x9D, ... constants): added
 * to whatever base the call site already adds its own retail constant to
 * (win->field_30's own position, or a per-star cursor), never an
 * independent origin. */
