"""The anime frame's frame styles and the rules that pick them (card_layout in mod.json).

A frame STYLE is a picture and the colour its small card in the hand wears:
  "frame_styles": {"green": {"image": "textures/anime_frame_magic.png", "hand_colour": "green", ...}}
A RULE says which cards wear which style, the first that applies wins:
  "frame_for": [{"class": "ritual_spell", "style": "green"}, ...]
  a rule may name a "class" (monster, effect_monster, spell, equip, ritual_spell, trap),
  a "tag" (a cards mod's "tags"), and a "setting" (a bool the mod declares, so a player can
  switch the rule on in the Mods window); one that names none applies to every card.
"default_style" is worn by a card no rule picks.
Both sizes of the card follow the style: the card view draws its picture, the hand paints its
frame in its colour. See notes/modding.md, "Card layout".

Used by hd_assets_pack.py (a build) and anime_frame_patch.py (an already built mod).
